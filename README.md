## Introduction

**Z‑Arena** is a next-generation coding competition platform. It enables users to solve, create, and compete in programming challenges across Z--, C++, Python, JavaScript, Rust, and more. Designed for education, hackathons, and developer communities, Z‑Arena is open-source, cloud-ready, and easy to extend.

---

## Features

- ⚡ **Multi-language support**: Z--, C++, Python, JavaScript, Rust, and more via Judge0
- 🧩 **Challenge system**: JSON-based, schema-validated, easy to extend
- 🏆 **Competitive modes**: War (PvP), streaks, leaderboards, achievements
- 🔒 **Secure & scalable**: Appwrite for auth, DB, and real-time; Dockerized backend
- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
- 🛠️ **Developer-friendly**: TypeScript, modular code, clear API/service layers
- ☁️ **Cloud-native**: Vercel (client), Render/Docker (server), Appwrite integration
- 📦 **Appwrite Functions**: Custom backend logic, challenge seeding, leaderboard updates

- **Frontend**: SPA, communicates with backend and Appwrite
- **Backend**: API, code execution, challenge logic
- **Compiler**: Z-- runtime (Node.js script)
- **Appwrite**: Auth, DB, real-time, storage, functions
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (Node 20+ recommended for Docker)
- npm or pnpm
- Git
- Appwrite instance (cloud or local) for full features

### Quickstart
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd Z-challenger

# Client setup
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173

# Server setup
cd ../server
npm install
npm run dev
# API at http://localhost:3000
```

## Configuration & Environment

### Client (`client/.env`)
| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT | Appwrite API endpoint |
| VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID | Appwrite project ID |
| VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID | Appwrite DB ID |
| VITE_APPWRITE_CHALLENGES_COLLECTION_ID | Challenges collection |
| VITE_APPWRITE_SUBMISSIONS_COLLECTION_ID | Submissions collection |
| VITE_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION_ID | Users collection |
| VITE_APPWRITE_STARS_LEVELS_COLLECTION_ID | Stars/levels collection |
| VITE_APPWRITE_ACHIEVEMENTS_COLLECTION_ID | Achievements collection |
| VITE_APPWRITE_LEADERBOARD_COLLECTION_ID | Leaderboard collection |
| VITE_APPWRITE_USER_RANKINGS_COLLECTION_ID | User rankings collection |
| VITE_SERVER_URL | Backend API URL |
| VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME | Cloudinary cloud name |
| VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET | Cloudinary upload preset |

### Server (`server/.env`)
| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| PORT | API port |
| JUDGE0_BASE_URI | Judge0 API endpoint |
| RAPID_API_KEY | Judge0 API key |
| COMPILER_PATH | Path to Z-- compiler script |
| CORS_ORIGIN | Allowed origins |

> **Note:** All `VITE_` variables must be set in Vercel for production. `COMPILER_PATH` in Docker/Render must be `/app/compiler/src/index.js`.

---

## Deployment

### Client (Vercel)
- Import project, set all `VITE_` env vars, deploy.

### Server (Render/Docker)
- Use `server/Dockerfile` (Node 20, multi-stage, LLVM ready)
- Set `COMPILER_PATH=/app/compiler/src/index.js` in env
- Deploy and monitor logs for errors

### Appwrite Functions
- Deploy from `appwrite-functions/` using Appwrite CLI or console
- Use `challenge-seeder/` to seed challenges

---

## Challenge System
- All challenges are JSON files in `/challenges/` (48+ included)
- Schema enforced via `/challenges/schema.json`
- Add new challenges by copying and editing a template
- Use seeder function to upload to Appwrite DB

---

## Appwrite Functions
- Located in `/appwrite-functions/`
- Includes: challenge seeder, leaderboard updater, submission processor, etc.
- Each function has its own README/config

---

## Security & Compliance
- See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure and security policy
- Follows best practices for API security, CORS, and secrets management

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
- **Missing features in production?** Ensure all env vars are set in Vercel/Render
- **Compiler errors?** Set `COMPILER_PATH` to `/app/compiler/src/index.js` in Docker/Render
- **Judge0 errors?** Check API key and endpoint
- **Appwrite issues?** Confirm collection IDs and permissions
- **More help?** See logs, open an issue, or contact support
